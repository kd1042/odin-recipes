    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Until now if you wanted lasagna, you had to make a lot, but thanks to this easy technique, that's all changed. This recipe makes 4 single-serve lasagnas, but you easily scale back and just make one, freezing the extra 3 pancakes for later use! The pancakes in this recipe are actually more like thick crepes that come out tasting like egg noodles. It's almost impossible to tell you didn't use pasta--since these pancakes taste like homemade lasagna noodles. Make it as-is or adapt it to your personal taste.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Â½ cups prepared marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon finely sliced fresh basil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Set out 4 small, shallow, oven-proof baking dishes or ramekins.</li>
        <li>Combine eggs, salt, olive oil, water, and flour for pancakes in a large bowl. Whisk thoroughly until very smooth, then let sit at room temperature for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine ricotta cheese, salt, pepper, cayenne, basil, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese for filling in a bowl; mix with a fork until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Prepare lasagnas: Spread 2 tablespoons marinara sauce into the bottom of each baking dish. Lay 1 pancake triangle on the sauce, then top with about 2 tablespoons ricotta filling, 1 tablespoon Monterey Jack cheese, and 2 teaspoons marinara.</li>
        <li>Place the baking dishes on a large sheet pan and bake in the center of the preheated oven until lightly browned and bubbly, about 15 minutes. Let cool for about 5 minutes, then garnish with basil and serve.</li>
        
    </ol>
